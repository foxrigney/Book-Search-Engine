# Overview

Using  MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js  used to build a full-stack MERN app.

Using React Router to make the application behave more like a multi-page application, it allows users to bookmark URLs and use the browserâ€™s forward and back buttons. With an added GraphQL, an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs you fetch only the data you want from the database when you need it. Finally, using JSON Web Token, or JWT, there is added authentication to your site.
